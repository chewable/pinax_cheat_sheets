# WHAT

Embedded in this repo are my cheat sheets for using the applications that are and can be embedded within a Pinax project.

# WHY

[The Pinax project](http://pinaxproject.com/) is a fantastic way to move forward with a
number of application components that have already been created for you. Unfortunately, it
currently isn't super-well documented if you want to know what's embedded and included, and how you might use some of those components in your own django applications.

This is an effort to document at least the basic internal components of Pinax. There are also getting started documents available within the Pinax project as well: [http://github.com/pinax/pinax/tree/0.7.1/docs](http://github.com/pinax/pinax/tree/0.7.1/docs)

# WHERE

You can find the source of the core of Pinax on [GitHub](http://github.com/) at [http://github.com/pinax/pinax/](http://github.com/pinax/pinax/). Pinax makes use of a number of external applications that aren't all included in that master project.

# CONTRIBUTING

If you want to add some commentary or additional detail to these cheat sheets, PLEASE DO! Just fork away on GitHub, and send me a pull request to have your updates included here. The format I'm using for all these documents is currently markdown, simply because I know it reasonably well and it renders nicely by default on GitHub.
